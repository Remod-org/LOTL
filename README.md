# LOTL

## Living Off The Loot - Inspired by Faceless

See his OLD series starting with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6_ldOgxCw0

This is intended to be run as the ONLY plugin.  It will prevent decay since resources are so rare to obtain.  If configured, a small number of players will randomly be issued bypass permissions allowing the abililty to obtain resources such as wood and stone.  Also, by default, admins can also gather resources.

Otherwise:

 - NO farming: trees, nodes, barrels, animals
 - NO picking up: stone, metal, sulfur, wood
 - NO harvesting: wild veg, hemp
 - CAN LOOT: bodies, items on the ground, directly lootable objects, your own plants from seed
 - CAN CRAFT: all

```js
{
  "debug": false,
  "seedPlayers": true,
  "allowAdmin": true,
  "Version": {
    "Major": 1,
    "Minor": 0,
    "Patch": 1
  }
}
```
